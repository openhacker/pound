1) git clone  git@github.com:openhacker/pound.git
2) run ./bootstrap
3) run ./configure
4) run make 
5) cd plugin-example; make

Plugin is currently very simple -- does round robin and one time "fails"

6) cd ..; ./pound -f test.conf

current configure has two servers on localhost (8001/8002, pound is localhost:8000)
